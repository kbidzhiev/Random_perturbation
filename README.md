# Random_perturbation



##What is this project about?

This is a scientific research project in quantum mechanics.
We study non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum spin chains.
Simply it means that we are interested in time evolution for a given 1D quantum state.


###### Which systems we study.

'Restricted' systems aka Folded and Dual Folded XYZ
